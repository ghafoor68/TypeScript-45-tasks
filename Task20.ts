// 20. Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

//  generic array type Array<elementtype>
let mountain:Array<string>=["K2","Takht-e-Sulaiman","Nanga Parbat"];
let rivers:Array<string>=["Indus","Kabul","Jehlum"];
let language:Array<string>=["Arabic","Sindhi","Urdu"];
let countries:Array<string>=["Palestine","Saudia Arabia","Kuwait"];
//  similar to array declare in javascript
let city:string[]=["Hala","Hyderabad","Karachi"];

console.log(`${mountain} \n ${rivers} \n ${language} \n ${countries} \n ${city}`)
